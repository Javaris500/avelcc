# Routes & Screens

**Status: `[specced]` — the route tree and screen contracts. Nothing built.**

*Owns: the frontend route map, the device boundary per route, and what each screen needs from the contract. Shapes are in `DATA-CONTRACTS-V2.md`; the pre-flight surface is specified in detail in `BLAST-RADIUS.md`.*

---

## Conventions

**Device classes** — the boundary is per route, not per app.

| Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 📱 **capture** | Works on a phone. Offline-capable where marked. |
| 🖥 **construction** | Desktop only. A phone gets "open this on desktop." |
| ✅ **approve** | Read + a single approving action. Phone-allowed; initiation is not. |

**Every screen gets four states** — loading (content-shaped skeleton), empty (designed, brand voice), error (mapped per `error.code`), success. Enforced by the `<Surface>` generic, not by memory:

```tsx
<Surface query={q} loading={<SkeletonRosterRow />} empty={<NoAgents />} error={ErrorState}>
  {(data) => …}
</Surface>
```

```

**Nothing at `/knowledge`.** KnowledgeEntry has no write path in V1 and an empty vault; a screen over zero rows is a screen that teaches you nothing. Deferred with the write-back.

## Contract gaps this map surfaces

`src/contract/` lists route groups for mission, roster, export, agent-template, skill, playbook, repo-policy, connection, activity.

| Gap | Needed by | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **No `client`, `engagement`, or `intake` route groups.** Three new entities with no procedures. | `/clients/*`, `/intake/:id` | **blocking** |
| **No `preset` route group.** RosterPreset is an entity with `preset.list/get/create/update/apply`, and `Playbook.default_preset_id` FKs to it. The contract has no file for it. | `/presets`, `/presets/:id`, and the loadout screen's "apply preset" | **blocking** |
| **No `skillSource` procedures.** The catalog is populated in-app; something must write it. | `/catalog/sources` | blocking for that screen |
| `export.preview` | pre-flight | specced in `BLAST-RADIUS.md`, not yet in the contract |
| `mission.getWithRoster` | loadout | named in v1, unbuilt |
| `skill.resolveTiers` | loadout | named in v1, unbuilt |
| `mission.list` → `lastActivity` | mission list | needs one aggregate join to ActivityLog, not an N+1 |

## Screens

### `/missions` — list 📱

**Needs:** `mission.list` (paginated, `lastActivity`)
**Empty:** first-run — this is the screen a new operator sees before anything exists. Design it as onboarding, not as a blank table.
**Row:** client · type · sprint · status · last activity · last export result.
**Note:** `lastActivity` is the known contract/implementation disagreement. Ship the column only when the join exists; do not substitute `updatedAt` — that is row-edit time, not audited activity.

### `/missions/new` and `/missions/:id/brief` — capture 📱 offline

The Phase Zero surface, and the only offline-capable one.

**Needs:** `mission.create`, `mission.update`
**Offline scope:** drafts persist locally; sync on reconnect. Nothing else in the app works offline.
**Design for:** one thumb, standing up, poor signal, mid-conversation with a client.
**Conflict rule:** a local draft that lost a race to a server edit surfaces both. Never silently discard the thing typed on a phone.

### `/missions/:id` — overview 📱

Hub. Brief summary · roster summary · playbook in effect · last export state · coherence status.

**Needs:** `mission.getWithRoster`, `playbook.getForType`
**Rule:** every construction action here is a link, not an inline control — the actions live on desktop routes.

### `/missions/:id/roster` — the loadout screen 🖥

**The core interaction.** Assemble the squad, tune each agent's skills, see coherence live.

**Needs:** `mission.getWithRoster` · `agentTemplate.list` · `skill.list` · `skill.resolveTiers` · `roster.upsert` · `roster.applyPreset` · `preset.list` *(missing)*

**Layout:** three panes — available agents · the roster with per-agent loadout · coherence panel.

**Coherence must be instant.** `computeCoherence(mission, playbook)` is pure — no DB, no IO, no clock. **Put it in `src/contract/`, next to the error union, and let both sides import it.** One implementation, zero round trips, no drift. The server remains authoritative at gate time; the client renders the same function.

**Interactions:** toggle agent active · assign waves · toggle skills (tiered: recommended / available / all) · edit `customized_md` · apply a preset (materializes RosterEntries — copy-then-edit, the preset holds no mission state) · save as preset.

**The one hard block:** at least one active agent in the earliest wave the playbook declares. Rendered as a block, not a warning — and it is the only thing on this screen that can prevent export.

### `/missions/:id/exports/new` — the pre-flight screen 🖥

**The screen that carries the product.** Preconditions → gates → verification → blast radius → one button.

Fully specified in **`BLAST-RADIUS.md`**, including the wireframe, the error codes, and the staleness rules. Do not re-derive it here. `ERROR_CODES` now carries **thirteen** — that document's twelve plus `IDEMPOTENCY_REPLAY`, which its own contract sketch named on `export.create`'s 409 without ever adding to the table.

**Non-negotiables:** deliver is disabled by state, never by styling · the base SHA and read age are always visible · attested gates are visually distinct from mechanical ones · initiation is desktop-only.

### `/missions/:id/exports/:exportId` — status ✅

Long-running. With mutation testing in the gate, `verifying` can run for an hour.

**Design as a resumable status view keyed on export id** — it must survive a closed tab, a reload, and a phone. Not a modal you have to keep open.

**States:** `pending · rendering · verifying · previewing · previewed · delivering · pr-open · done · failed`
**Shows:** live status · verification results as they land · blast radius · `gate_override` if present (permanently) · PR link · zip download.
**Phone may:** approve a previously computed preview. **Phone may not:** initiate.

### `/clients/new` — onboarding 🖥

Six steps. Canon runs at step 6; everything before it is mechanical.

| Step | What happens | Who |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Client record — name, contact | Form |
| 2 | Engagement — name, scope, dates | Form |
| 3 | Repository — URL, connect credential | Form + gateway |
| 4 | **Cut derivation** — read the directory structure, show the evidence | Code |
| 5 | `RepoPolicy` — confirm defaults | Form |
| 6 | Brief — paste call notes, Canon proposes | **Canon** |

**Step 4 is the screen worth building well.** Paste a repository URL and AVEL reports *"feature-organized, so one agent per feature"* or *"layer-organized, so one agent per layer"*, with the directory listing that decided it displayed alongside. `cut_source` is `derived`; an override requires written rationale that renders into the delivery.

That single step explains the entire roster model without a slide.

**Step 5 should be conspicuously unhelpful.** A repository with no policy row is treated as no-direct-push, so the empty state is the safe state. Do not nudge toward creating policies. Enabling direct push to a default branch is a deliberate confirmation with a warning, never a toggle.

### `/intake/:id` — Canon's proposal 📱

The approval surface. Canon has produced a structured brief and a list of open questions; nothing is executable until the operator approves.

**Needs:** `intake.get`, `intake.approve`, `intake.reject`, `intake.revise`

**Shows:** the raw source alongside the proposed brief, so the operator can check the interpretation against what was actually said. `open_questions` rendered as blocking items — an approval with unanswered questions should require acknowledging them.

**On approval:** materializes a Mission. The Intake row is retained as provenance.

**Phone-allowed** because reviewing and approving is exactly the shape of work that happens between meetings. Initiation stays on desktop.

### `/catalog/agents`, `/catalog/skills` 🖥

Library management. `identity_md` and `depth_md` are ≤800 tokens by Zod refinement — **show the count live in the editor.** A refinement failure discovered at save is a bad experience for content someone spent twenty minutes writing.

Skills carry `type: knowledge | capability`. **Label capability as declarative in the UI** — it names a tool grant, it does not enforce one. A badge that implies enforcement is the product lying about itself.

### `/playbooks/:missionType` 🖥

Gates (`mandatory | warn` only) · `waves_applicable` · `deliverable` · `required_fields` · `default_preset_id`.

**Show the consequence of every edit.** Removing phase1 from `waves_applicable` changes what the hard block resolves to. Marking a gate `warn` changes what can ship. This screen edits the rules that constrain the operator, so it should make that visible rather than presenting a form.

### `/settings/repositories` — RepoPolicy 🖥

`allow_direct_push_to_default` defaults **false**; a repo with no row is treated as false.

**The empty state is the correct state.** Do not nudge toward creating policies — safe behavior needs no setup, only the permissive behavior is opt-in. Enabling direct push to a default branch should require a deliberate confirmation, not a toggle.

### `/settings/connections` 🖥

Scope · status · rotation · revocation. **The token is never displayed** — `credential_ref` names where it lives.

**Revocation is a step in engagement close.** Make it a visible, one-click action with a confirmation, not something buried in an edit form. This is the largest real risk surface in the system and the UI should treat it that way.

Surface expiring credentials on the shell, not just here.

### `/activity` 🖥📱

Append-only. Filter by `action` domain, `entity_type`, mission, date. Both are closed vocabularies, so filters are enums — never free-text search over `action`.

## The device boundary

One guard, applied by route metadata:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/missions/$id/roster')({
  staticData: { device: 'construction' },
})
```

A phone hitting a construction route gets a designed screen — what it is, why it needs a desktop, and a way to send itself the link. Not a redirect, not a blank.

**Same codebase, same auth, same routes. Route split, not app split.**

**The rule that matters:** approving a gated export from mobile is fine. **Initiating an irreversible export from a phone is not** — that requires the desktop pre-flight first, enforced by `previewExportId` being required on `export.create` for `github_push`.

---

## Build order

**Demo-first note.** The pre-flight screen can be built against real data with no backend at all: the golden fixture is a real package, and `gitBlobSha` and `computeBlastRadius` are pure functions that can classify files in a real repository from one API call. That is the actual mechanism running in a browser with no schema, no API, and no export engine. Build it early.

Foundation first — six modules, no product screens until they exist:

1. `contract-client` · 2. `tokens` (extract `cc-palette.html`) · 3. `primitives` + `<Surface>` · 4. `error-map` · 5. `app-shell` · 6. `device-boundary`

Then:

7. `/missions` + `/missions/:id` — the smallest real loop
8. `/catalog/*` — the loadout screen needs content to assemble
9. `/missions/:id/roster` — the core interaction
10. `/missions/:id/exports/*` — the pre-flight screen
11. `/settings/*` · `/playbooks/*` · `/presets/*` · `/activity`

**Everything is built against contract-derived mocks** until the export engine exists. That is the point of the contract being an artifact — and it means the frontend is not blocked, but also that no screen is verified against real data until a mission runs.

## Open

| Question | Blocking? |
|---|---|
| `preset` route group missing from the contract | **Yes — blocks the loadout screen's preset flow** |
| Does `computeCoherence` ship in `src/contract/`? | **Yes — decide before the loadout screen** |
| TanStack Start vs. Vite + TanStack Router | No — the route tree is identical either way |
| Mobile approve: full pre-flight read-only, or a condensed summary? | Before `/exports/:exportId` |
| `MOBILE-PWA.md` does not exist | **Yes — blocks all 📱 offline work** |
