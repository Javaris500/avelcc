# Doc Ownership

*One fact, one owner. A fact restated in two documents will drift — this has happened three times on this project, twice within a single writing pass.*

*This replaces `DOC-RECONCILIATION.md`. That document asked an agent to be diligent; `scripts/check-docs.sh` checks instead.*

## The map

| Document | Owns | Must never contain |
|---|---|---|
| `PRODUCT.md` | The external pitch, the problem statement, the bet | Schema · stack names · build status · counts |
| `DECISIONS-V2.md` | Rationale, trades, rejected ideas, open questions | Schema blocks · stack tables · status |
| `DATA-CONTRACTS-V2.md` | Entity shapes, contract structure, invariants, migration order | "Why we changed" prose · status |
| `STACK-AND-RESOURCES.md` | Provisioning: what to install, what to sign up for, and when | Decisions · shapes · status |
| `TECH-STACK.md` | The tool table, one line each, operational notes | Re-argued rationale · schema · status |
| `STATE.md` | **All** build status, counts, gaps | Anything else |
| `CLIENT-CONTRACT-CONFORMANCE.md` | The client-side gate problem and its open decisions | Implementation before D1–D5 are answered |
| `BLAST-RADIUS.md` | The pre-delivery preview: remote tree read, diff, dry-run path, pre-flight screen | Verification gate logic · status counts |
| `ROUTES.md` | The frontend route tree, per-route device class, per-screen contract needs | Component internals · shapes · status |
| `COUNSELOS-STATE.md` | CounselOS current state, Slice 0 blockers, stack-specific mount globs | AVEL platform decisions |
| `STUDY-GUIDE.md` | Onboarding curriculum for developers joining the project | Decisions · shapes · status |
| `avel-gates-diagram.html` | The visual: phase flow, gate stages, interactive gate panel, cut comparison | — |
| `GOLDEN-FIXTURE.md` | The hand-written package the renderer must reproduce; the render specification | Schema shapes · status |
| `ROSTER-V2.md` | Agent roster, decomposition principle, phases, mount table, edge graph | Execution environment · status |
| `SANDBOX.md` | Where agents execute, isolation tiers, credential and egress boundaries | Roster composition · shapes |
| `PRIOR-ART.md` | Existing tools in this space, what to adopt vs. rebuild, the build/wrap decision | Shapes · status |
| `DEV-TIPS.md` | Build practice | Status · shapes · rationale |
| `MOBILE-PWA.md` *(missing)* | The mobile/desktop route boundary, offline scope, iOS push ordering | — |

**Cross-reference instead of restating.** "Zero missions have run" belongs in `STATE.md` and nowhere else; every other document links.

## Epistemic markers

Every claim carries its status inline. A reader — including a fresh session — must be able to tell a shipped mechanism from a reasoned intention, because these documents are written in one confident register and the register is not evidence.

| Marker | Means |
|---|---|
| `[built]` | Code exists, runs, is tested |
| `[specced]` | Designed in detail, not implemented |
| `[hypothesis]` | Believed, unmeasured — including every claim about agent-design efficacy |
| `[attestation]` | Enforced by an agent's report, not a mechanism |
| `[unspecified]` | Named as needed, shape unknown |

`[attestation]` exists because that is the project's recurring failure mode. Anything carrying it is a gap, not a feature.

## Stale-term denylist

These strings must not appear in `docs/` outside a "stale markers" line or this file. `scripts/check-docs.sh` enforces it.

```
tRPC                        → ts-rest
Supabase                    → Neon
bytea                       → R2 / snapshot_key
skippable                   → mandatory | warn + gate_override
Capability (as an entity)    → Skill.type = 'capability'
ADR-013 (for export targets) → the decision is in DECISIONS-V2
13 entities / thirteen      → twelve
25 AI agents                → 18 build + 1 human orchestrator + a support app
19 build agents             → 18 build agents (19 files, incl. the orchestrator)
```

## Rules

- **Report before fixing** still applies to *semantic* drift — where two docs disagree and canonical is silent, that is a question, not a judgment call.
- **Canonical wins** on entities, ADR numbers, and field shapes. Never "fix" canonical to match a repo doc.
- **Distinguish doc gaps from build gaps.** "RepoPolicy isn't in the shapes doc" is a doc gap. "RepoPolicy has no table" is a build gap and belongs in `STATE.md`.
- **Don't consolidate on your own initiative** — recommend it and explain.
- **The script is not sufficient.** It catches stale strings and duplicated status. It cannot catch two documents that describe the same mechanism differently in fresh words. That still needs reading.
