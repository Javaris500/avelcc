# Prior Art

**Status: `[decision required]` — one finding here changes AVEL's build surface substantially.**

*Owns: what already exists in this space, what AVEL should adopt rather than rebuild, and what remains genuinely AVEL's. Read before building the export engine.*

---

## The finding

**AVEL's delivery gate already exists, shipped, MIT-licensed, at 5.2k stars.**

`kunchenguid/no-mistakes` puts a local git proxy in front of the real remote. You push to the gate instead of `origin`; it spins up a disposable worktree, runs a validation pipeline — review → test → docs → lint — and forwards the branch to the push target and opens a PR **only after every check passes**. 392 commits, Go, 78 releases.

Read that against `PRODUCT.md`'s core mechanism. It is the same sentence.

This is not a reason to stop. It is a reason to stop building the part that exists and build the part that doesn't.

## no-mistakes

5,200 stars. 392 commits. Go. MIT licensed.

### What it is

A gate between committed work and the remote. Three entry points — `git push no-mistakes`, a TUI, and a `/no-mistakes` agent skill — all running one pipeline.

### The overlap with AVEL, stated plainly

| AVEL concept | `no-mistakes` equivalent | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Export won't deliver unless checks pass | The entire product | **Built. Better tested than AVEL will be.** |
| `verifying` status between render and delivery | The pipeline stage | Built |
| `Export.verification` structured artifact | `.no-mistakes/evidence/` — evidence committed to the repo | Built, and the on-disk evidence directory is a better idea than a JSONB column |
| `GitHubPrTarget` opening a clean PR | Automatic, with a generated body | Built |
| Disposable, non-disruptive verification environment | Disposable worktree | Built |
| Agent-agnostic runner | claude, codex, rovodev, opencode, pi, copilot, `acp:*`, with ordered fallbacks | Built, and broader than AVEL planned |

### Three ideas worth stealing regardless of what you decide

**1. Evidence as committed files, not a database column.** `.no-mistakes/evidence/` lives in the repo. That means the proof travels with the code, survives the platform, and is reviewable in the PR diff. AVEL's `Export.verification` JSONB is queryable but invisible to the client. **Do both** — render the evidence into `.avel/evidence/` in the package *and* keep the structured column for correlation. That is the same split as `version_manifest` in Postgres versus bytes in R2, and for the same reason.

**2. The findings model: `auto-fix` versus `ask-user`.** Safe, mechanical fixes get applied automatically; anything touching intent gets escalated to a human. AVEL has one binary — pass or fail — and a `gate_override` for the exceptions. A three-way split is better: *mechanically fixable* (fix it), *needs judgment* (escalate), *hard violation* (refuse, no override). AVEL's `BLAST_RADIUS_VIOLATION` is already the third category; it just lacks the first two as named concepts.

**3. They test their own workflows.** `workflow_ci_test.go`, `workflow_release_test.go`, `install_script_test.go`, `makefile_test.go`, `workflow_guard_generated_files_test.go`. Their CI configuration, install script, and Makefile all have tests. That is the "mechanism, not intention" discipline applied to their own infrastructure — the same move as `scripts/check-docs.sh`, and further along.

### Decision: map, don't adopt (resolved 2026-08-21)

**AVEL builds its own gate and borrows the design.** `no-mistakes` is prior art to learn from, not a dependency.

**The deciding reason is U2.** Its pipeline is AI-driven, which puts inference in the delivery path. AVEL's standing rule is that no inference enters render, freeze, gate, or delivery — that is the principle every other guarantee rests on, and wrapping a tool that violates it would hollow out the claim while appearing to strengthen it.

**Two supporting reasons:**

- **Different unit of work.** Its gate intercepts a *branch push*. AVEL's gate sits on a *rendered mission package* delivered into a client repository — content-addressed, reproducible, with a blast radius computed against the client's tree. Those are different artifacts at different boundaries.
- **U4.** Its evidence directory lands inside the client's repo under a third party's name. AVEL's delivery is made on the client's behalf and should not carry someone else's branding or format.

**What this costs, stated plainly:** the export engine returns to the critical path as the largest unstarted module. That is the price of the determinism rule, and it is worth paying — but it means **building the smallest gate that satisfies the thesis, not the most complete one.** Their pipeline has seven stages. AVEL needs four.

### The mapping

| `no-mistakes` mechanism | AVEL equivalent | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Push proxy** — the gate sits where work leaves for the remote | `export.create` — the gate sits where the package leaves for the client repo | **Confirms the placement.** Two independent arrivals at "gate the egress point, not the commit." |
| **Disposable worktree** per run | `SANDBOX.md` Tier 0 — worktree + container per agent | Already specced. Confirms the approach. |
| **`.no-mistakes/evidence/`** — evidence as committed files | `.avel/evidence/` rendered into the package, alongside `Export.verification` | **Adopt.** Proof travels with the code, reviewable in the PR diff. Same split as manifest-in-Postgres / bytes-in-R2. |
| **Findings: auto-fix vs. ask-user** | Three-way: mechanically-fixable, needs-judgment, hard violation | **Adopt and extend.** AVEL's `BLAST_RADIUS_VIOLATION` is already the third class; the first two are unnamed. |
| **Pipeline stage: review** (AI) | — | **Reject.** Inference in the delivery path. This is the U2 line. |
| **Pipeline stage: test** | `verification.tests` + `coverage` + `mutation` | Have it, and AVEL's is stronger — mutation scoring is the piece that catches a suite asserting nothing. |
| **Pipeline stage: lint** | `verification.analysis` | Have it. |
| **Pipeline stage: docs** | — | **Consider.** AVEL has no docs gate. A mission that ships undocumented interfaces is a real failure mode and this is cheap to add. |
| **Pipeline stage: PR + CI** | `GitHubPrTarget` + branch adoption on retry | Specced. |
| **`.no-mistakes.yaml`** — per-repo pipeline config | `Playbook` + `RepoPolicy` | Have both, and AVEL's is richer — process per mission *type*, not per repo. |
| **Agent-agnostic runner with ordered fallbacks** | The Capability-type Skill that produces the verification artifact | **Adopt the fallback chain.** A runner that fails should degrade to the next, not fail the export. |
| **`axi`** — non-interactive machine interface | AVEL's headless export path | **Adopt the principle.** Every gate must run with no TUI and no human present, or it cannot run in CI. |
| **Tests for their own CI, Makefile, install script** | `scripts/check-docs.sh`, extended to workflows | **Adopt.** Same discipline, further along. |

### What AVEL has that they do not

This is the honest scope of what remains worth building, and it is the reason mapping rather than adopting is the right call:

- **Mission composition** — which agents, equipped how, in what phases
- **The loadout screen and coherence** — the authoring surface entirely
- **Playbooks** — process per mission type, not per repository
- **Deterministic render** of a mission package, content-addressed and reproducible
- **Blast radius** against a *client* repository, with the TOCTOU guard
- **The multi-client agency layer** — `Connection` scoped per engagement, revocation at engagement close, `RepoPolicy` per repo
- **Client-side phase1↔phase2 conformance**

None of that exists in `no-mistakes`, and none of it is a gate. **The gate is the commodity; the mission is the product.** Build the gate small, and spend the effort above it.

## treehouse

1,000 stars. Go. MIT licensed.

A pool of reusable git worktrees so each agent session gets an isolated environment instantly, with dependencies and build cache intact. Detached HEAD to avoid branch-name conflicts, no daemon, durable leases with per-acquisition identity, in-use detection, atomic state with recovery.

### Direct relevance

AVEL runs multiple agents in waves. Nothing in AVEL's docs says where they run or how they avoid stepping on each other. The gap has been invisible for the reason given in `STATE.md`. This is the answer, and it is already built.

### The design worth studying closely

**`treehouse destroy` is `BLAST-RADIUS.md`, arrived at independently.**

- Dry run by default; `--yes` to execute
- A risk-revealing preview with per-target status labels — `[disposable]`, `[leased]`, `[in-use:<pid>]`, `[unmerged]`, `[dirty]`, `[unverified]`, and combinations
- **Each risky class is its own opt-in flag** — `--include-unlanded`, `--include-in-use`, `--include-leased` — so removing risky targets can never be a reflexive `--yes`
- The old blanket `--force` was **removed**, explicitly because it overrode every protection at once
- Never prints "all destroyed"; the summary states exactly what was destroyed and what was skipped
- A single named target skipped for lack of a flag exits non-zero, so scripts notice

That is the same conviction as AVEL's preview — and the per-risk-class opt-in is *better* than AVEL's current design. **Adopt it.** `BLAST-RADIUS.md` currently treats all violations as one blocking class. Splitting them by risk type, each requiring its own explicit acknowledgment, is strictly stronger than one `BLAST_RADIUS_VIOLATION` code.

**Also worth adopting:** the ABA-protection pattern on leases — `--if-lease-id` and `--if-lease-holder` compared while holding the state lock, so a retry cannot release a later acquisition of the same path. That is precisely the TOCTOU problem `BLAST-RADIUS.md` solves with `base_commit_sha`, solved the same way in a different domain. Two independent arrivals at the same answer is good evidence the answer is right.

## personal-agent-template

Vercel Labs. 31 stars. TypeScript and Vue. MIT licensed.

Different domain — a durable personal agent with web chat, Slack, Linear, and long-term memory. Relevant to AVEL for exactly one thing.

### Memory writes require explicit approval

The agent proposes facts via a `save_memory` tool; **nothing is stored until the user approves it in chat.** Memory is five fixed categories, one prose block each. Import from an existing assistant, then edit or delete on a profile page.

`DECISIONS-V2.md` already says: provenance, candidate-versus-promoted status, and forgetting first; retrieval second; **auto-promote never.** This is that policy, shipped, in a product that has actual users.

**What to take from it:**

- **Approval is an in-flow interaction, not an admin screen.** The proposal surfaces where the work is happening. AVEL's KnowledgeEntry write-back should propose at retro time, in the same surface, not queue into a review backlog nobody opens.
- **Fixed categories beat freeform.** Five slots, one prose block each. AVEL's KnowledgeEntry has six types already; the lesson is to resist growing them and to resist arbitrary-length entries.
- **A bounded memory stays legible.** Small enough that a human can read the whole thing is a feature, not a limitation — and it is the practical defense against the poisoned-entry failure mode.

**What it does not solve:** cross-client scoping. This is a single-user personal agent. AVEL's `KnowledgeEntry.agent_id` nullable-means-global still leaks between clients, and that remains a one-way door to close before the first write.

---

## hackerai

588 stars. 795 commits. TypeScript and Rust. Apache 2.0 with commercial restrictions.

An AI pentesting assistant. The product is irrelevant to AVEL; the **execution architecture is directly relevant**, because it answers two questions AVEL has left open.

### It answers the sandbox question

The agent runs untrusted code in **E2B** — a hosted sandbox service — rather than in a local container. AVEL's verification runner executes client dependencies and client tests, which is arbitrary third-party code, on a machine that must never hold the GitHub credential. `DECISIONS-V2.md` has no entry for where that runs.

E2B is one answer. Others: gVisor, Firecracker, a disposable cloud VM, or GitHub Actions runners if delivery moves to `no-mistakes`. The point is that this is a **decision AVEL has not made**, and hackerai shows what making it looks like in practice.

### It answers the durable-runtime question differently than AVEL did

The agent loop runs as a **Trigger.dev task** — an external durable runtime — with its own environment variables living on the worker rather than on the web host. AVEL chose pg-boss for the same reason (verification outlives a request and must survive a redeploy).

The environment split is the part worth noting regardless of which queue wins: **the worker's secrets are not the web app's secrets.** That is the same boundary as "the runner never sees the credential," enforced by deployment topology rather than by code.

### Two smaller things

**`skills-lock.json`.** A lockfile pinning agent skills, sitting next to `.agents/skills/`. AVEL versions `Skill` with a counter and relies on the frozen export snapshot for reproducibility. A lockfile is a different answer to the same problem — the *set* of skills at a point in time, resolvable and diffable, rather than reconstructed from a snapshot. Worth understanding before AVEL's skill library exists, because it is cheap now and awkward later.

**Moderation as a separate provider.** Content moderation runs through a different vendor than inference. Not currently relevant to AVEL, but the pattern — a check that does not share a provider with the thing being checked — is the same shape as reading verification from an artifact rather than from the agent.

## Agentic Design Patterns

2,800 stars. Reference material, not a tool.

**Not a tool.** A 424-page book by Antonio Gulli plus chapter notebooks — 21 chapters, 7 appendices. 7 commits.

**License warning, and it is the important part:** the repository states book content is © Antonio Gulli, all rights reserved; only the code examples are MIT. This is a third-party redistribution, not the author's own repo. **Do not vendor any of it into AVEL, do not paste chapters into agent context, and do not copy passages into AVEL's docs.** Read it, cite it, buy it. Treat anything derived from it as reference, not as an asset.

### The chapters that map onto AVEL's open problems

| Chapter | AVEL question it speaks to |
|---|---|
| 12 — Exception Handling and Recovery | What happens when a wave fails mid-mission; nothing in AVEL specifies recovery |
| 13 — Human-in-the-Loop | `gate_override`, the ask-user findings class, approval-gated memory writes |
| 16 — Resource-Aware Optimization | Cost governance, model tiering, the raised-but-unmechanized top financial risk |
| 18 — Guardrails / Safety | The runner/credential boundary, `writable_paths`, blast-radius violations |
| 19 — Evaluation and Monitoring | The measurement AVEL has none of |
| 8 — Memory Management | KnowledgeEntry, deferred until ~10 missions |
| 15 — Inter-Agent Communication | The phase1↔phase2 contract problem |
| Appendix G — Coding Agents | The whole domain |

**How to use it:** as a source of *names and known failure modes* for problems AVEL has already hit independently, not as a design to implement. The value is in discovering that a problem you solved by instinct has a name and a literature — which is how you find out whether your solution is the good one or the obvious one.

## Summary of changes to AVEL

**Adopt:**

| From | What | Into |
|---|---|---|
| `no-mistakes` | Evidence rendered as committed files, alongside the structured column | `BLAST-RADIUS.md`, render spec |
| `no-mistakes` | Three-way findings: auto-fix, ask-user, hard violation | `DECISIONS-V2.md`, gate model |
| `no-mistakes` | Test your own CI, install, and build config | `DEV-TIPS.md` |
| `treehouse` | Per-risk-class opt-in flags instead of one violation class | `BLAST-RADIUS.md` |
| `treehouse` | Worktree pool as the agent execution environment | New — currently unspecified in AVEL |
| `personal-agent-template` | Approval in-flow, fixed categories, bounded size | KnowledgeEntry, when it is built |
| `hackerai` | A named sandbox for the verification runner | New — currently unspecified |
| `hackerai` | Worker secrets separate from web secrets, by deployment topology | `TECH-STACK.md`, operational notes |
| `hackerai` | Skill lockfile as an alternative to counter-versioning | `DATA-CONTRACTS-V2.md`, before the skill library exists |
| `Agentic-Design-Patterns` | Vocabulary and known failure modes — **reference only, license-restricted** | Reading, not code |

**Reconsider:** whether the export engine gets built or wrapped. See the A/B decision above.

**Unchanged and still AVEL's alone:**

- Mission composition and the roster
- The loadout screen and live coherence
- Playbooks as process per mission type
- Deterministic render of a mission package
- The multi-client agency layer: `RepoPolicy`, `Connection` scoped per engagement, revocation at engagement close
- Blast radius against a client repository rather than a local worktree
- Client-side phase 1 to phase 2 contract conformance

That last list is the honest scope of the project, and it is smaller and sharper than what the docs currently describe. **Smaller is the correct direction.** The standing problem has been design ahead of evidence; deleting work that someone else has already shipped better is the fastest available way to close that gap.

## Questions to answer before implementing any of this

**Why this section exists.** Adopting a dependency has the same failure mode as building one — enthusiasm ahead of evidence. Every row in the table above is currently a *good impression from a README*. None of it has been tested against AVEL's actual constraints. These are the questions that turn an impression into a decision.

**The rule:** nothing above gets implemented until its blocking questions are answered in writing, here, with a date. An unanswered blocking question means the item stays on this page and out of the codebase.

---

### Universal — ask these of every candidate

**U1. What does it cost to leave?**
If this dependency is abandoned, acquired, or relicensed in a year, what has to be rewritten? A tool that shapes AVEL's data model is a much bigger commitment than one that shapes a build step.

**U2. Does it fit AVEL's determinism rule, or bend it?**
The core is deterministic by design — no inference in render, freeze, gate, or delivery. `no-mistakes` runs an **AI-driven** pipeline. That is inference in the delivery path. Does composing it violate the standing rule, or does the rule apply only to AVEL's own render? **This needs an explicit answer, not an assumption**, because it is the one principle everything else in the architecture rests on.

**U3. What does the license actually permit for a commercial agency?**
MIT is fine. `hackerai` is Apache 2.0 **with commercial restrictions** — read them before any code moves. `Agentic-Design-Patterns` is all-rights-reserved book content.

**U4. Does adopting this make the client's package depend on it?**
A tool AVEL uses internally is reversible. A tool whose artifacts end up inside a client's repository is a commitment made on the client's behalf, and it outlives the engagement.

**U5. What is the smallest test that would falsify the enthusiasm?**
For each item: what is the one-afternoon experiment that shows this does *not* work for AVEL? Run that before the integration, not after.

### `no-mistakes` — the build-or-wrap decision

| # | Question | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| N1 | Can a **custom gate criterion** be added as a pipeline stage — specifically a mutation-score floor and a coverage delta? Read `.no-mistakes.yaml` and the pipeline docs. | **Yes — decides Option A vs. B entirely** |
| N2 | Does the pipeline read results from **artifacts**, or from an agent's report? If the latter, it is an attestation and does not satisfy `PRODUCT.md`'s core mechanism. | **Yes — this is the whole thesis** |
| N3 | Can it push to an **arbitrary client repository** with a scoped credential, or does it assume the operator's own remote? | **Yes — AVEL's entire use case is other people's repos** |
| N4 | What exactly lands in `.no-mistakes/evidence/`, and is it acceptable for that to appear in a client's repo under AVEL's name? | **Yes — see U4** |
| N5 | Does its AI-driven pipeline stage make delivery nondeterministic in a way that breaks preview-vs-real hash comparison? | **Yes — that comparison is AVEL's free determinism gate** |
| N6 | Can it run headlessly in CI with no TUI and no human present? | Yes |
| N7 | How does it behave on a **retry** — adopt the existing branch, or open a second PR? | Before first client use |
| N8 | Where does its worktree run, and does that environment ever hold AVEL's credential? | Before first client use |

**Superseded by the mapping decision above.** N1–N8 no longer gate a build-or-wrap choice. They remain useful as *design questions* — read the answers to learn how `no-mistakes` solved each problem before AVEL solves it again. N2 in particular (artifact vs. attestation) and N7 (retry adopts the branch rather than opening a second PR) are worth reading before writing the equivalent code.

---

### `treehouse` — execution environment

| # | Question | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | Are AVEL's waves actually **parallel**, or sequential with parallel authoring? If sequential, a worktree pool solves a problem AVEL does not have. | **Yes — determines whether this is needed at all** |
| T2 | Does the pool model survive agents needing **different dependency states** in the same repo at the same time? | Yes |
| T3 | Is the per-risk-class opt-in pattern being **adopted as a design**, or is the dependency being taken? These are different decisions with different costs. | **Yes — the design is free; the dependency is not** |
| T4 | Does the lease identity model (`--if-lease-id`, compared under the state lock) map cleanly onto `base_commit_sha`, or are they solving different races? | Before rewriting `BLAST-RADIUS.md` |

**Note:** T3 is the important one. The dry-run-by-default, per-risk-flag, never-blanket-`--force` design can be adopted into `BLAST-RADIUS.md` at zero cost and zero dependency. Take the design first; decide on the tool separately.

---

### `hackerai` — sandbox and durable runtime

| # | Question | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | Where does AVEL's verification runner execute? Local container, E2B, Firecracker/gVisor, disposable VM, GitHub Actions. **Currently unspecified anywhere.** | **Yes — blocks the export engine and any client work** |
| H2 | Is **network egress denied by default** in the runner, with an allowlist for the package registry? | **Yes — this is the cheap defense against the supply-chain case** |
| H3 | Is it architecturally guaranteed — not merely conventional — that the runner process never has access to the GitHub credential? | **Yes — one-way door; free now, expensive later** |
| H4 | What does sandboxed verification cost per export at realistic client-repo size, with the changed-files mutation scope already decided? | **Yes — this is the unmodeled compute cost** |
| H5 | Does pg-boss still win over an external durable runtime once verification is minutes-to-hours and running in a sandbox elsewhere? | Before the export engine |
| H6 | Lockfile or counter-versioning for skills? Decide **before the skill library exists** — `base_skills` currently seeds empty, which makes this free today. | Before the skill library is populated |
| H7 | What are the commercial restrictions on its Apache 2.0 variant? | Before any code is referenced |

---

### `Agentic-Design-Patterns` — reference only

| # | Question | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Confirmed that no content is vendored into AVEL, pasted into agent context, or copied into docs? | **Yes — license** |
| A2 | For each chapter that names a problem AVEL solved by instinct: is AVEL's solution the good one, or merely the obvious one? | No — but this is the actual value |

---
